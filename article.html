<p>Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, is famed for its rusty red appearance. The Red Planet is a cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. But the dusty, lifeless (as far as we know it) planet is far from dull. </p>
<p>Phenomenal dust storms can grow so large they engulf the entire planet, temperatures can get so cold that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere condenses directly into snow or frost, and marsquakes — a Mars version of an earthquake — regularly shake things up. </p>
<p>It, therefore, comes as no surprise that this little red rock continues to intrigue scientists and is one of the most explored bodies in the <a href="https://www.space.com/16080-solar-system-planets.html">solar system</a>, according to <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/">NASA Science</a></p>
